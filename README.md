This project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings. It then takes the
input information and caluclates a price for the order.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game
The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first
and then users are off playing the classic game. Users can decide which token each player wants
to use and the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.

C# Projects
These are some small projects I made using C# and NET Framework
Projects:
• Car Insurance
• NFL Stats

Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input
on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin
page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

NFL Stats
This is a data visualization application that is meant to store and display football stats for the
purposes of fantasy football. It is an MVC web application that utilizes Entity Framework 6 for
data access and a Code First workflow. It is still a work in progress.
